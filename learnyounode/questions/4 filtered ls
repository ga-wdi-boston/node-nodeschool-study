## FILTERED LS (Exercise 5 of 13)

 Create a program that prints a list of files in a given directory,
 filtered by the extension of the files. You will be provided a directory
 name as the first argument to your program (e.g. '/path/to/dir/') and a
 file extension to filter by as the second argument.

 For example, if you get 'txt' as the second argument then you will need to
 filter the list to only files that end with .txt. Note that the second
 argument will not come prefixed with a '.'.

 The list of files should be printed to the console, one file per line. You
 must use asynchronous I/O.

## HINTS

 The fs.readdir() method takes a pathname as its first argument and a
 callback as its second. The callback signature is:

    function callback (err, list) { /* ... */ }  

 where list is an array of filename strings.

 You may also find node's path module helpful, particularly the extname
 method.
